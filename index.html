   <h3>All About Me:</h3>
   <p> My name is Michelle and I am a 10th grader currently attending Thomas A. Edison High school. To start off with, my ethnic background is Guyanese. 
      Some of my favorite things are the color pink, listening to music, hibiscus flowers, and shopping. I also have always wanted to go into the medical field 
      since I was younger. If you were to ask to describe myself in 3 words I would say compassionate, ambitious, and self-less. My biggest goal in life is to be able to provide for my family.
      To end off, I love the Fall and I was born in September. </p>
