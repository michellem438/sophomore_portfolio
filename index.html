   <h3>All About Me:</h3>
   <p> My name is Michelle and I am a 10th grader currently attending <a href="https://www.taehs.org/" target="_blank">Thomas A. Edison High School.</a> To start off with, my ethnic background is Guyanese. 
      Some of my favorite things are the color pink, listening to music, hibiscus flowers, and shopping. I also have always wanted to go into the medical field 
      since I was younger. If you were to ask to describe myself in 3 words I would say compassionate, ambitious, and self-less. My biggest goal in life is to be able to provide for my family.
      To end off, I love the Fall and I was born in September. </p>
