   <h1> Hi! My name is Michelle Maipaul!</h1>
   
   <h2> Welcome to my 10th grade portfolio! I am taking Web & App Development courses.</h2>

   <h3>All About Me!</h3>
   <p> My name is Michelle and I am a 10th grader currently attending Thomas A. Edison Highschool.
      In order to get to know me better as a person I will inform you on some facts about me. To start off with, my ethnic background is Guyanese. 
      Some of my favorite things are the color pink, listening to music, hibiscus flowers, and shopping. I also have always wanted to go into the medical field 
      since I was younger. If you were to ask to describe myself in 3 words I would say compassionate, ambitious, and self-less. The reason I delineate myself as these character traits
   is because I am the type of person who will always someone else before me and I am a driven person. My biggest goal in life is to be able to provide for my family.
   To end off, my favorite singers are Jhene Aiko and PARTYNEXTDOOR, I love the fall, and I was born in September. </p>
